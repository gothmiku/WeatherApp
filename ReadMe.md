# Weather App
### Quick Introduction
This is one of my projects where I try to learn Kotlin and Android Studio. On this one specifically, I will focus on learning DI and the XML Layout.


### Setup
Before compiling and building the app, you need to have an account and a valid API key from [OpenWeather.com](https://openweathermap.org/api). 

You need to copy the key to your local properties in the project as seen below;
```
sdk.dir=C\:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk 
API_KEY = "YOUR API KEY HERE"
```

### Used technologies
* Hilt
* Room
* Material design (wip)
* GSON
